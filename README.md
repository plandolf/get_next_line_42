# get_next_line_42

# Introduction
get_next_line is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it. This project aims to enhance understanding of file I/O operations in C and the usage of static variables for maintaining state across function calls.

# Features
1) Read Line from File Descriptor: Reads and returns a line from the given file descriptor.
2) Static Variables: Uses static variables to maintain state information between multiple function calls.
3) Memory Management: Ensures proper allocation and deallocation of memory to avoid leaks.

# Prerequisites
A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
GNU Make

# Installation
1) git clone [repository-url] get_next_line
2) cd get_next_line
